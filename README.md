# Vue

Note: These projects require markers and videos, when I initially made this, the videos were stored locally but that took up a lot of space
so I removed the marker links so that if you want, you can connect the marker to a url and play a video using the url as well. Although, getting
the aspect ratio to be accurate might be difficult if the video is played from a url.

## This app,
identifies a marker(I used movie posters) and plays a corresponding video(The movie's trailer). The video is overlayed on the area
of the marker(how big the poster is) and any interruptions simply pause the video and don't restart it.

## I later realized,
that this can be used for many other things, like a billboard can be used as a marker and people can point their phones at the billboard and 
a more detailed, video version of the ad can be displayed. This will have huge implications in 5-10 years when smart glasses become the standard.

Safe to say, Augmented Reality is a work in progress, and so is this project!
